In the third week, my code submission didn't follow the conventions as the commit messages were informal. I then resubmitted the code with 
proper commit messages.

In the fourth week, there was an error in the comments when comparing the sizes of c and f in my code. I have changed "# The car commute is 
quicker because f (95 minutes) is less than c (90 minutes)" to "# The car commute is quicker because f (95 minutes) is larger than c (90 
minutes)".

In the fifth week, language_popularity.py didn't contain a a variable for activity that can be modified. So I add a variable language and the code will return popularity of a given language.
language = "JavaScrip". print(f"The percentage of the users of {language} is {language_popularity[language]}.")
